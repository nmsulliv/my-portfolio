        Here are a few projects I enjoyed creating; they also taught me
        valuable skills! These projects are written in Assembly, Java, 
        and C++.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, here are my 
        <a href="https://github.com/nmsulliv" target="_blank">Github</a> and

      <h3>C++ Infinite Natural Number</h3>
      <p>
        This is a C++ program which computes addition, multiplication,
        or factorials no matter how large the result is. For example: 50!
        cannot normally be computed with type long int, but this program
        is able to calculate and print the result -

      </p>
      <p>
        This project taught me how to create an arbitrary precision 
        calculator, and the importance of arbitrary precision 
        calculations to avoid overflow.

      <h3>MIPS Base Converter</h3>
      <p>
        This is a MIPS program which reads a string of exactly 10 characters
        from user input. It will then output the conversion of the string in
        base 30. However, if the string contains characters outside of '0-9',
        'a-t' or 'A-T', it will print out invalid input. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This program taught me the basics of assembly programming, how to work
        with registers, and how to use QTSpim. Originally I thought 
        this program seemed simple, but I quickly learned how intricate assembly
        programming is, and how important it is to efficiently manage memory.

      <h3>C++ Benchmark Project</h3>
      <p>
        This is a C++ program which computes the execution time for
        billions of CPU, memory, and hard drive operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this project I learned how to write benchmark tests, and the 
        importance of SPEC Benchmarks. I also learned how to write binary
        files - which I think is pretty cool!

      <h3>Java Ten-Pin Bowling Calculator</h3>
      <p>
        This program takes in an integer array of a sequence of throws 
        for one game of Ten-Pin Bowling, and produces the score for the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is currently no GUI, but the purpose of this coding exercise
        was to learn about JUnit testing. This project taught me how to use
        the JUnit testing framework, as well as how to code in Java.
