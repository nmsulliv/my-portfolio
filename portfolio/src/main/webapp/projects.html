      <h1>Past Projects</h1>
      <p>
          Here are a few projects I enjoyed creating; they also taught me
          valuable skills! These projects are written in Assembly, Java, 
          and C++.
      </p>
      <h3>Java Ten-Pin Bowling Calculator</h3>
      <p>
          This program takes in an integer array of a sequence of throws 
          for one game of Ten-Pin Bowling, and produces the score for the game.
      </p>
      <p>
          There is currently no GUI, but the purpose of this coding exercise
          was to learn about JUnit testing. This project taught me how to use
          the JUnit testing framework, as well as how to code in Java.
      </p>
      <h3>MIPS Base Converter</h3>
      <p>
          This is a MIPS program reads a string of exactly 10 characters from 
          user input. It will then output the conversion of the string in base
          30. However, it the string contains characters outside of '0-9',
          'a-t' or 'A-T', it will print out invalid input. 
      </p>
      <p>
          This program taught me the basics of assembly programming, how to work
          with registers, and how to use QTSpim. Orginally I thought 
          this program seemed simple, but I quickly learned how intricate assembly
          programming is, and how important it is to effeciently manage memory.
